this is a simple binary to text decoder. uses two txt files

main.py was made for creating and shaping up the binary.txt and translation.txt files from the orginal ASCII code, because I just copy pasted the chart and was too lazy to do it myself, so main.py is not used anymore.

binary_translator.py is just a simple program with two functions, one that translates a string of binary into text, and another that does the reverse.

each dictionary sets the values in each file equal to each other or however dictionarys work, so that they can be called for each value

mainly this project was for me learning how to use dictionarys and how they worked, and to translate binary text on the walls of my CS-105 class at Furman University, Riley hall room 206. No spoilers for what it says.
